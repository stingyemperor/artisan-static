### **Literature Review**

Since sketch based modelling is the hardest part of my proposed project, most of the research papers discussed are based on that topic.

The different sketch based modelling systems can be divided into 4 different classes as described in [Kazmi et al., 2014]. We will be discussing three of these four classes as they are more important to the proposed project. A lot of the discussions on these papers is based on the information provided in [Kazmi et al., 2014] and [Bonnici et al, 2019] .The classes are single view systems, multi view systems and curve networks based systems. Lastly, there is a section on the use of techniques from machine learning like CNN GAN’s, in sketch based modelling research, as most of the recent research papers utilize these techniques. 


##### Single View Systems

In Single view systems, the 3-D model based on a single user drawn image.

One of the  first sketch based interface we discuss is Teddy[Igarashi et al., 1999]. In Teddy the user sketches a 2-D silhouette of the desired shape. Then, the 2-D silhouette is converted to a 3-D object through the operation of bobby inflation. This 3-D object can be edited by cutting and adding elements. While this interface is very simple and intuitive to use, it cannot handle complex shapes, particularly those with sharp edges. Another issue with Teddy is that it does not process cusps and T-junction strokes. FiberMesh [Nealen et al., 2007] introduced a system based on teddy that overcame some of the limitations of teddy. FiberMesh allows users to freely deform the generated curves. This allows for a higher level of control and detail and compared to teddy. But similar to teddy, curves generated by fibremesh lack sharp features.

##### Multi View Systems

Multi view systems use two or more images taken at different views to construct the 3-D model.

Rivers et al [Rivers et al, 2010] proposes an approach in which models are interactively designed by drawing their 2-D silhouettes, thus eliminating the need for the user to have the ability to position 3-D elements. This approach is capable of producing highly detailed models with relatively simple sketches. The system targets objects that can typically be expressed as axis-aligned subparts. The resulting models are fairly detailed and produce excellent results in certain cases.The main drawback of this approach is that multiple 2-D sketches  from different views are required in order to make the 3-D model, which is slow and also requires the user to have the ability to describe the object from multiple orthographic views.

##### Curve networks based Systems

Curve based network systems utilize the 3-D space available to artists to draw strokes. These systems allow the user to navigate the canvas by providing operations like zooming, rotating and panning. 

The first curve networks based system we look at is ILoveSketch [Bae et al, 2008]. ILoveSketch is designed to provide the user a sketchbook like experience with almost no UI elements. The interface makes abundant use of the interactivity of touchscreens 

and tries to eliminate menus. The system relies heavily on a stroke inference engine to transform strokes into curves  and has features to tolerate rough user inputs like multi-strokes and disjoint strokes. This system works very well for mechanical designs but less so for organic models. The system also lacks the ability to adjust curves easily.

A system that builds on ILoveSketch [Bae et al, 2008] is JustDDrawIt[Grimm & Joshi, 2012] . JustDrawIt has many of the same features as ILoveSketch and add systems that enable convenient editing of existing curves. It also has in built visualizations aids like shadows and depth-based shading. JustDrawIt can be viewed as three different systems put together. A 2-D sketching system, 3-D curve editing system and 3-D surfacing. The main drawback of this system is that it seems to have a high learning curve and does not provide any tests on inexperienced users, as noted in [Kazmi et al., 2014].


##### Deep Sketch based Modelling

Deep sketch based modelling is a recent development that has received a lot of attention in recent years. The discussions on the papers discussed below are based on [Zhong et al, 2021] and [Bonnici et al, 2019] .

The first paper we look at is 3D Sketching using Multi-View Deep Volumetric Prediction [Delanoy et al , 2018] which constructs 3-D shapes from one or more drawings using a deep CNN that predicts occupancy of a voxel grid from a line drawing. The single view is updated with an updater CNN which updates the model based on subsequent drawings. This allows the interface to be very simple with the rendered output visible after each step.  Currently, the models have very low detail and also lack sharp features. The models are also limited by the shapes that the CNN is trained on.

A similar CNN based model is proposed in [Li et al., 2018].  [Li et al., 2018] uses a CNN to predict depth maps using flow field regression and similar to [Delanoy et al , 2018] , the user can draw additional lines to refine or add details. It also allows for the user to utilize over sketched strokes to represent stronger curvature.

Another easy-to-use proposal is presented by [Jin et al,2020].[Jin et al,2020] constructs the 3-D model by using  three silhouettes from the front,side and top view. It proposes a space that jointly embeds both 2-D  occluding contours and 3-D shapes via a variational autoencoder. Since the 3-D models are generated directly from the contour, it is very user friendly and can be expanded to generate complicated models with additional inputs. 

In terms of user interface, I want to point out the paper [Wailly et al, 2019] which presents the user with a 3-D grid to draw on and uses two CNN networks, one for classification and one for parameter estimation, to predict the position and dimension of the recognized shape. The 3-D grid interface is rendered from a ¾ bird’s eye viewpoint which I think is a good balance between complexity and ease of access.
