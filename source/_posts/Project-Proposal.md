### **Sketch based 3-D modelling for general shapes**

					


                    Samraat Gupta


#### Description

Digital drawing software like photoshop and clip studio paint lack convenient shadow references. Clip studio paint provides 3-D models with rendered shadows, but the amount of models available are very limited and does not allow for custom models. Thus, many  artists generally use a software like blender to help with obtaining references for shadows.  This is very inconvenient for users, as 3-D modelling programs are complicated to use.

The project aims to tackle this problem by providing users with an interface that can convert their 2-D drawings into 3-D models. These 3-D models can then be used to calculate shadows. While calculating shadows is mostly a closed problem now, 2-D sketch to 3-D models is still an active area of research. Recent papers in the area of sketch based modelling are combining machine learning with techniques from geometric modelling, but there is still work to be done with regards to finding a balance between usability and accuracy.


#### Goals

The primary goal of this project is to build an interface that coverts 2-D sketches to 3-D models  and subsequently rendering shadows for these models. The interface should be intuitive to use (not more complex than using a digital drawing software.) while also allowing the user to freely edit the drawings in a  convenient way to get more detailed models. The position, intensity, direction and number of light of sources should also be editable easily. The user should be able to freely draw in a 3-D space with either a mouse input or a digital pen input. If everything in the project goes smoothly, I would like to add the option of colored surfaces and colored light sources to help with coloring reference in addition to shadows. Also, since digital interfaces with pressure and tilt support are getting more common nowadays, these features can be used to add more information to the 2-D sketches like information related to curvature.
